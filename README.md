# Accessibility-Checklist

## Perceivable

- [ ] Images and visual elements have concise and descriptive Alt Text.

- [ ] Videos have captions, and audio have transcripts.

- [ ] Content has semantically correct headings (e.g. h1, h2) and not just bolded text.

- [ ] Text or graphical objects that are interactive have a good color contrast between the background and foreground.

- [ ] Content uses a method other than just color to convey meaning.

- [ ] Content has a minimum font size of 16px.

## Operable

- [ ] All content is accessible using only a keyboard without requiring a mouse.

- [ ] There is no flashing content at a frequency of more than 3 flashes per second.

- [ ] The purpose of links can be determined by the link text alone.

- [ ] Interactive elements can be used with a touch screen. (e.g. Buttons and interactive elements are large enough to easily be tapped.)

## Understandable

- [ ] Avoids metaphors, similes, idioms, proverbs, expressions or turns of phrase that may confuse someone from a different language or culture. (e.g. "Break a leg".)

- [ ] Uses common words instead of fancy, less-common ones where possible.

- [ ] Sentences are split when required to improve clarity.

- [ ] Sentences use simple tenses. (e.g. "Press the ON button" instead of "the ON button should be pressed".)

- [ ] Avoid using acronyms unless they have already been explicitly defined. (e.g. Subject Matter Expert (SME))

## Robust

- [ ] Where possible, font sizes use relative units (e.g. 2em) instead of explicit units (e.g. 40px).
